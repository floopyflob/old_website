                warm welcome, dear stranger!<br>
                don't know how you ended up on this page, but there's something i gotta tell you.<br>
                this website acts as a sort of an archive for a website, that i've been building over the past year and a half (?).<br>
                it's mainly a showcase of how i developed as an html editor.<br>
                i really needed to move on from this project. it was fun, but all comes to an end.<br>
                btw, the social site links lead to defunct profiles. i deleted them.<br>
                hav a good wandering stranger on the internet. for now, buh bye :3
